Listened to a podcast on [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/06/09/532303452/episode-777-free-love-free-market) about the [Oneida Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community), which was basically a weird sex cult that also made flatware and animal traps. I'd heard about them in my Intro to American History class in college, but the details are so much more interesting than I remember!

I listened to a [podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-society-on-your-face/) today about [face mites](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/youve-got-face-mites/). This, of course, inspired me to find some more articles. This is easily the most disturbing thing I read today:

>Though this new research has a small sample size, it adds to a large number of studies that conclude mites are in your pores, having sex, right now.
>
>Although, not pooping on you. Neither species has an anus; they just store up all the poop until they die. After death their grip relaxes and they are released onto the surface of your skin; their DNA and waste joins the oily layer keeping your epidermis moisturized.

Turns out that face mites tend to live about 14 days. Fourteen days of no pooping!

Driving to Indian, AK to have some barbecue for dinner, I started to wonder who has the largest tide change in the world. [Evidently](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/highesttide.html), the Bay of Fundy in Canada wins the award, at 16.3 meters (53.5 feet). The Cook Inlet is the largest in the US, coming in at 12.2 meters (40.0 feet).

There are some pretty spectacular videos of the Cook Inlet bore tide on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubmYx6HZgNo).
