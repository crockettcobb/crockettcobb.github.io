While listening [To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://www.ttbook.org/book/radioactive-clocks-and-women-poisoned-them) today, I heard about the radium girls. This wasn't the first time I'd heard of the girls who were poisoned by licking their radium-laced paintbrushes used to create glow-in-the-dark watch faces; however, it was the first I'd ever heard that the [radium dial factory Luminous Processes](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2017/03/radium-superfund-legacy/519408/) operated until *1978*.

The town is now a hotbed for cancer (of course), and there are folks who are buried in lead-lined coffins in the town because their corpses remain a public health hazard. Anecdotally, a Geiger counter can be used to find the remains of the girls who worked in the factories early on.

I re-listened to [this](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/06/28/534735727/episode-286-libertarian-summer-camp) Planet Money podcast on a Libertarian summer camp in New Hampshire today. The folks there typically refer to the US Dollar as the "US Federal Note" because they want gold-backed currency. Some folks there invented their own gold and silver lamination machine to sell their own version of currency, which might be the [Aurum](http://valaurum.com/what-is-an-aurum/). Thankfully, it looks like an attempt at crowdfunding the AurumCoin on IndieGoGo [failed](https://www.geektime.com/2017/01/22/aurumcoin-the-curious-case-of-the-gold-backed-digital-currency-indiegogo-campaign-that-wasnt/).

I just finished listening to 99% Invisible's episode on [birth control packaging design](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/repackaging-the-pill/). It is fascinating that the original design of something that was so time-sensitive was originally packaged in a simple prescription pill bottle. If a woman couldn't remember if she had taken a dose, the guidance was to count the remaining pills and consult a calendar. The man who [designed the alternative packaging](http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/packaging-pill) was an engineer who eventually got a patent for the packaging we use today, but the pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to use it. 

I suppose it just goes to show that even stellar ideas aren't always immediately recognized.
